        <h3>What is JabberStatus?</h3>
        <p>
          JabberStatus is a way of updating your Facebook or Twitter status from your Jabber (or Google Talk) account. Using it is simple! Just add <span style="font-weight:bold">facebook@jabber.org</span> or <span style="font-weight:bold">twitterstatus@jabber.org</span> to your contact list, and it will talk you through the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: red">WARNING:</span> This code is still being tested. While it works for most cases, if things go wrong, it can get a little confused, although nothing bad can happen. If this happens, just remove it from your contact list and re-add it.
        </p>
        <h3>Privacy</h3>
        <p>
          For Facebook, we never see your username or password, but we do have an authentication key which lets us set your status. 
          Unfortunately, for Twitter, the only way we can provide this service is if you give us your username and password. We store an encrypted version, so it shouldn't be leaked in any way.
          We don't know any other information about you apart from your Jabber ID. Obviously, we won't give any of this information to anyone else. If you remove us from your contact list, we throw all your information away.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are concerned about us storing this information, then you can grab the code and run your own version, as far away from us as you like. See the "developers" section below for more information.
        </p>
