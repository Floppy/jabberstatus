JabberStatus
------------

A Ruby app which implements an XMPP -> Status gateway for Facebook and Twitter.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

ruby >= 1.8
rubygems
xmpp4r >= 0.3.2
facebooker >= subversion rev 217 (0.9.5 doesn't work)
twitter >= 0.3.7
log4r >= 1.0.5
daemons >= 1.0.10
json >= 1.1.2

INSTALLATION
------------

If you want to *use* the service, you don't need to install anything. Just add
facebook@jabber.org or twitterstatus@jabber.org to your Jabber contact list 
and follow the instructions.

If you don't trust me with your information (sensible), and want to run your own
version of the gateway:

1) Download from http://floppy.github.com/jabberstatus

2) Extract to a directory on your machine (tar xzvf jabberstatus.*.tar.gz)

3) Copy config/config_example.yml to config/config.yml.

4) Edit config/config.yml to add the jabber account login details you 
   want to use for the gateway.

5) For facebook, create a desktop app on facebook, and enter your API and secret 
   key into config/config.yml. For Twitter, just make up a couple of secret keys
   and enter them in config/config.yml. Note that you can only run one at a time,
   so if you want to do both, you will need two instances running with different
   config files.

6) Run "ruby bin/jabberstatus_control.rb start" to start the service (you can
   also use the stop, restart and run commands).

7) Add the Jabber account in config.yml to your contact list, and enjoy updating
   your status through Jabber!
